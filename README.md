# Building a working HMRC 'Add to List' pattern
## Introduction
The HMRC â€˜Add To List' pattern allows users to add more than one item to a list. Its great for capturing repeating data based on a specific topic. It follows a standard flow which can be repeated multiple times to build the full picture. I have personally used this pattern across many government departments and although some departments have slightly differing patterns, the HMRC version is often seen as the benchmark.

This is a more advanced how-to guide to demonstrate how to build a working version of the pattern within your prototype.
